# MSBX 5420-003: Unstructured and Distributed Data Modeling and Analysis
## COVID-19 Twitter Data Ingest and Analysis
## Team Mount Evans

Team Mount Evanâ€™s objective for the project was to analyze large sets of Twitter data produced in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data analyzed stretched from the beginning of March 2020 to the beginning of April 2020. While the data came from all across the world, the team decided to analyze tweets that are in English only. The data was sourced from Kaggle.com. The team used GitHub as a centralized repository for shared data files and working code. The team also used AWS EMR for storage, code construction, and as a local cluster to test iterations of code. The methodology is described below:

## Description

Step 1: Distributing Raw Data

Step 2: AWS EMR

Step 3: Final Deployment

* More detailed information can be found in the [Design Document.](https://github.com/MSBX5420/team_mount_evans/blob/master/Design%20Document.txt) This will include a code diagram of operations to run the applicable final code. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Utilized Python as the base language, including the following packages:
* TextBlob for sentiment analysis
* Spark wrapper
* Pyspark.Sql
* Statsmodel.api
* Matplotlib & Pyplot
* Pandas
* WordCloud

Github repository used for version control & code management


### Packages
* matplotlib 
* pyspark.sql
* seaborn
* io 
* datetime
* sys
* pickle 
* statsmodels
* pandas
* numpy
* wordcloud
* textblob

## Code Links

Final Code Used for EMR Deployment
* [Final Code.py](https://github.com/MSBX5420/team_mount_evans/blob/master/Final%20Code.py)
* [Final Code.ipynb](https://github.com/MSBX5420/team_mount_evans/blob/master/Final%20Code.ipynb)

The following code links are segments developed locally prior to the final deloyment of the entire dataset. The code below was tested on a small subset of the data and applied to the master file upon deployment.
