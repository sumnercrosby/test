# MSBX 5420-003: Unstructured and Distributed Data Modeling and Analysis
# COVID-19 Twitter Data Ingest and Analysis
## Team Mount Evans

Team Mount Evanâ€™s objective for the project was to analyze large sets of Twitter data produced in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data analyzed stretched from the beginning of March 2020 to the beginning of April 2020. While the data came from all across the world, the team decided to analyze tweets that are in English only. The data was sourced from Kaggle.com. The team used GitHub as a centralized repository for shared data files and working code. The team also used AWS EMR for storage, code construction, and as a local cluster to test iterations of code. The methodology is described below:
